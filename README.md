===================================

Provide a simple site indexer for processwire pages.
  - Now Supporting Page Fields
  - Support for Repeater Fields
  - Automatic text extraction from all fields.
 - Text extraction from .pdf and .doc files (will use poppler-utils and vw if available, but includes pure PHP classes for PDFs and various flavours of word processor docs, which may be sufficient).
  - English / Italian stopwords feature.
